## 1st year Experimental Data

Applications used:
- Polybench/C benchmark suite
- 3 CORAL mini-apps (STREAM, CLOMP, XSBench)

Experiments on:
1. Overall application sensitivity to execution over slower memory components.
2. Data object contribution to the performance slowdown, when application is executing over slower memory components. 
3. Per application performance in various collocation scenarios of applications with different sensitivity levels.
